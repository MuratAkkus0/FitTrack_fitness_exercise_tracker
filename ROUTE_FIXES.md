# Route Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Training Program Routes

**Problem:** Template was trying to use `app_training_program_update` route which doesn't exist.

**Solution:**

- **Actual Route:** `app_training_program_edit` (GET|POST)
- **Fixed in:** `templates/user_dashboard/my_programs/index.html.twig`
- **Changed:** `data-program-management-update-url-value` → `data-program-management-edit-url-value`
- **Updated Controller:** `assets/controllers/program_management_controller.js`
  - Changed `updateUrl` value to `editUrl`
  - Updated URL building logic to use placeholder replacement
  - Changed HTTP method from PUT to POST (as expected by the route)

### 2. Exercise Library API Routes

**Problem:** Template was trying to use `app_exercise_library_api_exercises` route which doesn't exist.

**Solution:**

- **Actual Route:** `app_exercise_library_api` (GET)
- **Fixed in:** `templates/user_dashboard/exercise_library/index.html.twig`
- **Changed:** `app_exercise_library_api_exercises` → `app_exercise_library_api`

### 3. Add Exercise to Program Route

**Problem:** Template was trying to use `app_training_program_api_add_exercise` route which doesn't exist, and the controller was sending data incorrectly.

**Solution:**

- **Actual Route:** `app_training_program_add_exercise` (POST)
- **Route Pattern:** `/training-program/{programId}/add-exercise/{exerciseId}`
- **Fixed in:** `assets/controllers/exercise_library_controller.js`
  - Removed dependency on `addToProgramUrlValue`
  - Built URL dynamically with programId and exerciseId in path
  - Removed JSON body (not needed since IDs are in URL)
- **Updated Template:** Removed unused `data-exercise-library-add-to-program-url-value`
