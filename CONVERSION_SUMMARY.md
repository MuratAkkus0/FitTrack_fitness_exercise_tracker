- Exercise selection with visual feedback
- Modal management with proper lifecycle
- Form validation and submission
- Program deletion with confirmation
- Exercise count tracking
- API integration for program CRUD operations

**Targets:** 7 targets for form and modal management
**Values:** 3 URL values for API endpoints
